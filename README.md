**A smart attendance management system** where students can mark their attendance from home, inside the college, or in the classroom. Teachers receive attendance in real-time, verify students' presence manually or through auto-scan (location or proximity check), communicate with students, assign tasks, and download monthly attendance reports in PDF.

The app also includes chat features, notifications, and complete student profiles.
