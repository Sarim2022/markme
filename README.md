📚 Introduction: MarkMyAttendence

MarkMyAttendence is a comprehensive, location-aware Android application designed to modernize and 
simplify the process of marking, managing, and monitoring student attendance in educational institutions. 
Built for both educators and students, it replaces traditional, often cumbersome, attendance methods 
with a secure, real-time, and efficient digital solution. The platform features robust class management 
tools for teachers, including unique class codes for secure student enrollment, automated chat group 
creation for seamless communication, and a calendar view for schedule management. Crucially, it incorporates 
a secure attendance mechanism that allows students to mark their presence both within and outside the 
college premises, strictly controlled by the teacher's ability to activate attendance only when the class 
is officially in session. With timely reminders and detailed reporting features, MarkMyAttendence aims to 
enhance punctuality, streamline administrative tasks, and improve overall classroom engagement.
